JavaScript is single-threaded. This means that it carries out asynchronous operations via the callback queue and event loop

1)Single Threaded
2)asynchronous
3) callback quere 
4) call stack
5) Event loop

Memory Management :
JavaScript engines have two places to store data: 

Stack: stores static data. Static data refers to data whose size is known by the engine during compile time. 
static data includes 
1) primitive  data type : strings, numbers, boolean, null, and undefined. 
2) References that point to objects and functions . 
A fixed amount of memory is allocated for static data. This process is known as static memory allocation.

Heap: It is used to store objects and functions in JavaScript. The engine doesnâ€™t allocate a fixed amount of memory. Instead, it allocates more space as required.
Stack
